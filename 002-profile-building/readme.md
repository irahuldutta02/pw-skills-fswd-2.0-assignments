## Answers ✅

1. UI (User Interface) refers to the visual elements and design of a product, while UX (User Experience) refers to the overall experience and usability of a product. UI design focuses on creating an attractive and functional interface that users can interact with, while UX design focuses on understanding user behavior and creating a product that is intuitive and easy to use. In other words, UI is the look and feel of a product, while UX is the overall user experience.

2. A frontend developer is a programmer who specializes in creating the user-facing interface of a website or application. Their role is to take the designs and specifications provided by the UI/UX designers and turn them into a working product using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frontend developers are responsible for implementing the visual and interactive elements of a website or application, ensuring that it is accessible and responsive across different devices and browsers, and optimizing it for speed and performance.

3. A backend developer is a programmer who specializes in developing and maintaining the server-side components of a website or application. Their role is to handle the logic and functionality of a website or application that users don't see, such as database management, server-side scripting, and API development. Backend developers are responsible for ensuring that the server-side code is secure, scalable, and efficient, and that it interacts seamlessly with the frontend code. They may also be responsible for setting up and configuring the server infrastructure, monitoring server performance, and troubleshooting issues as they arise.
