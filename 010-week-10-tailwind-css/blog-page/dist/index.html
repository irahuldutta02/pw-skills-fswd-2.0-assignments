                writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to
                rescue it from near bankruptcy in
                1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's most valuable company.
                Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music,
                phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of
                America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was
                a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied
                imagination to technology and business.

                <p class="text-left">One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most
                    of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough
                    on people. "Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart
                    people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at
                    another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they
                    don't." Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost
                    wistfully, "And we got some amazing things done." Indeed, he
                    and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years
                    that was greater than that of any other innovative company in
                    modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores,
                    MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention
                    every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
                    surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had
                    been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and
                    four children.</p>
