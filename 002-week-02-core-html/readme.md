### 3. Write a short note on tags, elements, and attributes along with relevant examples.

__Answer :__

In web development, tags, elements, and attributes are fundamental concepts that define the structure and presentation of web pages. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. Tags: Tags are the building blocks of HTML documents that define the structure and content of a web page. They are enclosed in angled brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs (opening and closing tags) that surround the content. For example, the `<h1>` tag defines a heading, and the `<p>` tag defines a paragraph. Here's an example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

2. Elements: Elements are made up of opening and closing tags and everything in between. They define the structure and content of the web page. For example, the <head> and <body> elements are two of the most important elements in HTML. Here's an example:

```
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
```

3. Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about an element, such as the color, size, or location of the element on the web page. They are added to the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value separated by an equal sign. For example, the "src" attribute specifies the URL of an image, and the "href" attribute specifies the URL of a hyperlink. Here's an example:

```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A picture of a mountain" />
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example.com</a>
```

In summary, tags define the function of an element, elements define the structure and content of a web page, and attributes provide additional information about an element. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building and designing web pages.

### 4. List out any 3 tags we learned in this module and give a brief explanation about the tags.

__Answer :__

Here are three HTML tags that we learned in this module, along with a brief explanation of each:

1. `<div>` tag: The `<div>` tag is a container element used to group together other elements on a web page. It is commonly used to create a block-level container that can be styled with CSS. The `<div>` tag has no inherent meaning or semantic value, but it provides a way to organize and structure content. Here's an example:

```
<div class="container">
  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p>This is some content that I want to group together.</p>
</div>
```

2. `<a>` tag: The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks to other web pages, files, or locations within the same web page. It requires a `href` attribute that specifies the destination of the link. The `href` attribute can be an absolute or relative URL, or it can point to an ID within the same document. Here's an example:

```
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example.com</a>
```

3. `<img>` tag: The `<img>` tag is used to insert images into a web page. It requires a `src` attribute that specifies the URL of the image file. It can also include optional attributes such as `alt`, `width`, and `height` to provide additional information about the image. Here's an example:

```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A picture of a mountain" width="500" height="300" />
```

These are just a few of the many HTML tags available for web development. By understanding the purpose and proper use of each tag, you can create well-structured and functional web pages.


### 5. What is emmet? List some of the advantages emmet offers?

__Answer :__

Emmet is a shorthand syntax for HTML, CSS, and other web development languages that allows you to write code faster and more efficiently. Emmet was originally called Zen Coding, and it was created by Sergey Chikuyonok. Here are some of the advantages of using Emmet:

1. Speed: Emmet is designed to help you write code faster by reducing the amount of typing required. With Emmet, you can type a few shorthand characters and expand them into full HTML or CSS code.

2. Efficiency: Emmet allows you to write more efficient code by using shorthand syntax to represent common patterns in web development. For example, you can use the `ul>li*3` shorthand to create an unordered list with three list items.

3. Customization: Emmet is highly customizable, and you can create your own custom abbreviations and snippets to suit your needs. This allows you to create your own shortcuts and save time in your workflow.

4. Cross-platform support: Emmet works with many different text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs), including Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Atom. This makes it a versatile tool that you can use in your preferred development environment.

5. Consistency: Emmet encourages a consistent coding style by providing a standardized syntax for HTML and CSS. This makes it easier to maintain and update your code over time.

Overall, Emmet is a powerful tool that can save you time and improve your workflow in web development. By using Emmet to write efficient and consistent code, you can focus on creating great web content without getting bogged down in the details of syntax and formatting.

### 6. Using emmet create another webpage similar to questions 1 and 2.

__Answer :__

here's an example of how to use Emmet to create a basic HTML webpage with a header, main content, and footer:

```
html>(head>title{My Website})+(body>(header>h1{Welcome to my website!})+(main>h2{About Me}+p{Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed pharetra purus ac purus euismod, vel tempor velit congue. Duis semper diam non libero ultricies, vel iaculis sapien pharetra. Donec in mi nec magna placerat congue.}+(img[src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x300"]{Image}+)+h2{Contact Me}+ul>li{Email: email@example.com}+li{Phone: 555-1234}+)+footer>p{Copyright © 2023})
```

This code will create a basic webpage with a header that includes a welcome message, a main content area with an image and some text about the author, and a footer with a copyright notice. Note that this code includes a placeholder image URL; you can replace this with the URL of your own image.

Once you've created the code using Emmet, you can copy and paste it into a new HTML file and save it with a .html extension. When you open the file in your web browser, you should see a basic webpage with the content you created using Emmet.

### 7. Explain in brief about the nesting operators in emmet.

__Answer :__



### 8. Build a simple webpage using any 2 emmet abbreviations and above the elements mention the emmet abbreviation using HTML comments. The below image is for reference.
<img src="https://github.com/irahuldutta02/pw-skills-fswd-2.0-assignments/assets/78687135/55f6b846-271d-4566-a6c9-d82ad485dd90" alt="question-2.8" width="90%">

__Answer :__

Sure, here's an example of how to use Emmet to create a simple webpage with a header and a main content area:

```
<!-- Header section -->
header>(h1{My Website}+nav>ul>li*3>a{Link})+

<!-- Main content section -->
main>(h2{Welcome}+p{Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed pharetra purus ac purus euismod, vel tempor velit congue. Duis semper diam non libero ultricies, vel iaculis sapien pharetra. Donec in mi nec magna placerat congue.})+
```

This code will create a basic webpage with a header that includes a site title and a navigation menu, and a main content area with a heading and some sample text. Note that the `>` character in the Emmet abbreviations represents a parent-child relationship between elements.


### 9. What are self-closing tags? Write a brief note on meta tags.

__Answer :__

Self-closing tags, also known as void elements, are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag because they do not have any content inside them. Instead, these tags are written with a trailing slash at the end of the opening tag. Some common examples of self-closing tags include `<img>`, `<input>`, `<br>`, and `<meta>`.

The `<meta>` tag is a special HTML tag that is used to provide information about a webpage to web browsers and search engines. The `<meta>` tag is included in the `<head>` section of an HTML document, and it can include a variety of attributes to provide different types of information.

Here are some of the most common attributes used in the `<meta>` tag:

- `name`: Specifies the name of the metadata being provided (e.g. `name="description"`).
- `content`: Specifies the content of the metadata being provided (e.g. `content="This is a description of my webpage."`).
- `charset`: Specifies the character encoding used in the HTML document (e.g. `charset="UTF-8"`).
- `http-equiv`: Specifies an HTTP header to be sent to the browser (e.g. `http-equiv="refresh"` to redirect the browser to a new URL).

The `<meta>` tag can be used to provide a wide range of information about a webpage, including its title, description, author, keywords, and more. This information is used by search engines and social media platforms to display previews of the webpage and help users find relevant content.

Overall, self-closing tags and the `<meta>` tag are important features of HTML that help developers create effective and efficient web content. By understanding how these tags work and how to use them effectively, developers can create webpages that are both user-friendly and search engine-friendly.

### 10. What are global attributes? List any 5 global attributes.

__Answer :__

Global attributes in HTML are attributes that can be used with any HTML element. These attributes provide a way to add additional information to an element, such as an ID or a class, or to specify how an element should behave, such as whether it should be hidden or clickable.

Here are five examples of global attributes in HTML:

1. `class`: Specifies one or more CSS classes to apply to an element. Classes are used to group elements together and apply styles to them.
2. `id`: Specifies a unique identifier for an element. IDs are used to refer to specific elements in CSS and JavaScript.
3. `style`: Specifies one or more inline styles to apply to an element. Inline styles override any styles specified in a CSS stylesheet.
4. `title`: Specifies a title or tooltip for an element. This text is displayed when a user hovers over the element with their mouse.
5. `data-*`: Specifies custom data attributes for an element. These attributes can be used to store additional data about an element that is not visible on the page.

There are many other global attributes in HTML, including `accesskey`, `contenteditable`, `dir`, `lang`, `tabindex`, and more. These attributes provide a flexible and powerful way to customize the behavior and appearance of HTML elements on a webpage.
