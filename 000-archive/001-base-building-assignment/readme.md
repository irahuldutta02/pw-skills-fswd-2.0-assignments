## Answers ✅

1. The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer systems that
communicate with each other using standardized protocols. It allows people
worldwide to share and access information, communicate with each other, and
perform various tasks like shopping, banking, and entertainment online.

2. A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view web
pages on the internet. It works by sending requests to web servers and receiving
responses containing the requested content, which is then displayed to the user.
Some popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft
Edge, and Safari.

3. A browser engine, also known as a rendering engine, is a software component
that interprets the markup language used to create web pages and renders them into
a visual representation that can be displayed in a web browser. It processes HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript code and translates it into a graphical user interface that users
can interact with.

4. A static site is a website that consists of individual web pages that are pre-written
and stored on a web server. The content of these pages does not change unless
manually updated by a website administrator. Static sites are simple to create and
host, and they are often used for small businesses or personal blogs.

5. A dynamic site is a website that is created on the fly as the user interacts with it.
These sites typically use server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby
to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in response to user requests.
Dynamic sites often have more complex functionality, such as user authentication,
e-commerce features, and real-time data updates. Examples of dynamic sites
include social media platforms, e-commerce stores, and online banking portals.
