2. How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?
3. What are elements, tags, and attributes, and the difference between them.
4. Briefly explain what HTML entities are.

## Answers ✅

1. "Hello, World!" is a simple program that is often used as the first program when learning a new programming language. It is used to introduce the basic structure of a program and to ensure that the development environment is set up correctly. By writing a "Hello, World!" program, a new programmer can quickly gain confidence in their ability to write and execute code.

2. Comments are used to add notes or explanations to code, without affecting the code's behavior. They are useful for providing context to other developers who may be working on the same code, as well as for reminding oneself of why certain code was written in a particular way. In HTML, comments are written using the `<!-- -->` syntax. Anything written between these symbols will be ignored by the browser and will not be displayed on the webpage.

3. - In HTML, an element is a basic building block of a webpage, representing a specific type of content or structure, such as headings, paragraphs, or images. An element is defined by an opening tag, a closing tag, and the content that appears between them. For example, the `<h1>` and `</h1>` tags define a heading element, and the text between them is the heading's content.

    - Tags are used to define HTML elements, and they are enclosed in angle brackets. Tags consist of an opening tag, which starts with the tag name, and a closing tag, which is identical to the opening tag but includes a forward slash before the tag name. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and `</p>` is the closing tag.

    - Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element, such as its style or behavior. Attributes are added to the opening tag and are made up of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. For example, the `src` attribute in an image tag (`<img>`) specifies the source file for the image.

4. HTML entities are special characters that cannot be typed directly into an HTML document, but can be represented using special codes. For example, the `&lt;` entity represents a less-than symbol (`<`), and the `&nbsp;` entity represents a non-breaking space. HTML entities are useful for representing characters that have special meaning in HTML, such as angle brackets or ampersands.
