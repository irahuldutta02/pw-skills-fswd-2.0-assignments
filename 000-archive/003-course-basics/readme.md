## Answers ✅

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring content for the web. It provides a set of tags and attributes that define the structure and layout of a webpage.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. It allows developers to separate the presentation and layout of a webpage from its content, providing greater control over the visual appearance of a website.

3. JavaScript was created to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Before JavaScript, web pages were static and lacked the ability to respond to user input. JavaScript allowed for the creation of interactive elements like pop-up windows, drop-down menus, and form validation.

4. JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially, it was called Mocha, then changed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. It was designed as a scripting language for the Netscape Navigator web browser. JavaScript quickly became popular due to its ability to add interactivity to web pages.
In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) for standardization. The result was the first version of ECMAScript, which was released in 1997. Since then, new versions of ECMAScript have been released regularly, with the latest version being ECMAScript 2021. Each version introduces new features and improvements to the language.
In conclusion, JavaScript was created to add interactivity to web pages, and ECMAScript was created to standardize the language and ensure its continued evolution.
